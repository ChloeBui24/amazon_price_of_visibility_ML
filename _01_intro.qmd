# Introduction

In the digital marketplace, visibility is currency. When consumers search for health and baby care products on Amazon, the order in which products appear can dramatically influence purchasing decisions, brand perception, and ultimately, consumer welfare. This project investigates the fundamental question: *What factors influence the ordering of product search results on Amazon's site within the Health & Baby Care categories?*

The positioning of products in search results represents a complex intersection of commercial interests and consumer behavior. Products that secure top positions naturally receive disproportionate attention, leading to increased traffic, higher conversion rates, and enhanced perceived credibility among consumers. This phenomenon, known as the "position bias effect," has been extensively documented in search engine research and e-commerce studies, where users demonstrate a strong tendency to click on results appearing higher in the list, regardless of their objective quality or relevance [@manomanopositionbias; @kdnuggetspositionbias; @ecommercepositionbias].

Our research focuses specifically on Amazon's Health & Baby Care categories, where product placement decisions carry heightened significance. Unlike general merchandise, health-related products directly impact consumer well-being, making the transparency and fairness of ranking algorithms a matter of public interest. When parents search for baby formula or adults seek dietary supplements, the products they encounter first may influence decisions that affect their family's health and safety.

This investigation serves multiple stakeholders. For sellers, understanding the mechanics of product visibility provides strategic insights for optimizing their market presence through pricing, branding, and promotional strategies. For consumers, revealing the factors behind product ordering enables more informed purchasing decisions by understanding whether top-ranked products earn their position through merit or algorithmic preferences.
